Description

Optimize WP is a utility plugin, even though it's was developed with a focus on developers as many functionalities are what you might just add to every new website you build, it's really easy to use, just check the boxes corresponding to the set up you want. It will help you:

Cleanup your website head and also some markup included with shortcodes section.
Prettify the search url, ex: http://yourwebsite.com/search/search-terms.
Load jQuery from Google CDN(default) or form your chosen cdn provider instead of using the hosted version.
Change the p to figure tag to surround your images.
Add Retina support for your images.
Add additional images sizes and modify those.
Setup a Logo and background color for your login page
Hide Administration menu items with a simple checkbox setup
Add some more privacy adding a "referrer" meta tag
If Yoast SEO is activated, can remove Yoast comments in head
Set up for SMTP email settings
And actually many other things. Also besides the retina options(where you will be able to choose whether add the script from CDN or not), this plugin won't add any scritp or styles to your website frontend

Stay tuned as it will get updated possibly often with new features
